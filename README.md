# expensive TTN mapper

This repository contains the code for the Arduino UNO with the Draguino Lora GPS shield. It is meant as a mobile hardware for ttn mapper.
For this device to work there are a few more things to do to get the data on ttn mapper web site. Plese, folow the instruction on the ttn mapper website.

### hardware components and connections
Necessary hardware is Arduino UNO and Draguino Lora GPS shield. You will also need two jumper wires to connect UART to the GPS. In the picture below is shown how to connect the jumper wires.
